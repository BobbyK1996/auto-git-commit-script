# auto-git-commit-script

Bash files to automate the process of committing to git.

One for main and the other for a branch of name 'experimental.'

Before this can be used the first time, type 'chmod +x git_push_main.sh' or 'chmod +x git_push_branch.sh' into terminal, depending on which is being used.

Can then commit using ./git_push_main.sh "Commit message here"

As usual, rockets because they're fun :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:
